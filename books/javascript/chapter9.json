    "Static analysis reduces runtime surprises. We compare TypeScript\u2019s structural typing with Flow, and demonstrate gradual typing via JSDoc annotations. Topics include generics, utility types, declaration files, and migrating legacy code.",
    "Beyond types, tools like ESLint, SonarQube, and dependency scanners catch security and performance issues. The chapter emphasizes enforcing contracts at build time while keeping developer experience smooth."
