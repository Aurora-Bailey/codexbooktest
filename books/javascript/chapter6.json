    "Node.js extends JavaScript to the server using libuv for asynchronous I/O. We examine the module loader, CommonJS versus ES Modules, and package management with npm and pnpm. Streams power efficient data pipelines; examples include file uploads and HTTP proxies.",
    "Building REST APIs involves routing, middleware, and response serialization. We compare Express, Fastify, and native `http` patterns, touching on observability, clustering, and deployment with containers or serverless platforms."
