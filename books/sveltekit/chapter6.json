    "SvelteKit treats HTML forms as first class citizens by pairing them with actions defined in `+page.server.js`. Submitting a form posts to the same URL, the action validates data, and the result returns success or failure states that hydrate the component through the `$page` store. This means you can build robust forms without writing fetch calls manually. Flash messages, field level errors, and file uploads flow through the same mechanism.",
    "Progressive enhancement ensures the experience stays usable when JavaScript fails or when network conditions degrade. The `enhance` helper allows you to intercept submissions, add optimistic UI, or perform custom analytics while keeping the server implementation authoritative. Because actions run on the server, secrets remain safe, yet the client can still sprinkle interactivity democratically."
